# HTML TIMELINE
This project attempts to recreate a mockup image using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.

## Notes:
This project uses some heavily customized CSS and JS in order to achieve desired results. I had first attempted this project using something like the CSS Grid, however, this was not giving me desired behavior. Due to this, I had to structure this project from the ground up using a variety of nested `<div>`'s and wrappers, using `float`, to achieve desired results. **Warning** Inserting your own content may require a lot of CSS fine tuning. A good future project might be to attempt to re-build this project using `<canvas>` to draw the timeline lines, and see if utilizing CSS Grid can get closer to desired behavior. This would take away a lot of headache and remove a lot of code.
